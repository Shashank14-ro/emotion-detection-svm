# emotion-detection-svm
Classical ML (SVM) approach on extracted facial feature

# Emotion Detection using SVM ðŸ˜ŠðŸ“Š

This project performs facial emotion classification using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). It uses extracted features from facial images and trains a classical machine learning model to classify emotions such as happy, sad, angry, and surprised.


## ðŸ§  Features

- Facial emotion classification using SVM
- Feature extraction from facial landmarks or image pixels
- Trained and tested on emotion datasets (e.g., FER2013, JAFFE)
- High accuracy with classical ML approach
- Lightweight and fast for small applications


## ðŸ’» Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - OpenCV (for image handling and face detection)
  - Scikit-learn (SVM, preprocessing)
  - NumPy, pandas, matplotlib
- **Optional**: dlib or Mediapipe (for facial landmarks)

ðŸ”¬ Feature Extraction Methods
```
Option 1: Flattened grayscale pixel values (basic)

Option 2: Facial landmarks (using dlib or Mediapipe)

Option 3: Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)
```
You can switch the method in feature_extraction.py.
